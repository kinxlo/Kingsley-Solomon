        review: `Kingsley is not only well-versed in his domain, but he is amazing at transferring his knowledge to others.  Despite the majority of our class having a non-technical background, we were all able to grasp the fundamentals of web development to the point of building complex projects, thanks to Kingsley’s sheer dedication, patience and willingness to assist.  His highly engaging and right-paced lessons gave me the required technical/programming foundation required to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science in the UK.`
